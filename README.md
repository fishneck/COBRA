# Quantifying Impairment and Disease Severity Using AI Models Trained on Healthy Subjects

Automatic assessment of impairment and disease severity is a key challenge in data-driven medicine. We propose a novel framework to address
this challenge, which leverages AI models trained exclusively on healthy subjects. The models are designed to predict a clinically-meaningful
attribute of the healthy patients. When presented with data where the attribute is affected by the medical condition of interest, the models experience a decrease in confidence that can be used to quantify deviation from the healthy population. The resulting **COnfidence-Based chaRacterization of Anomalies (COBRA)** score was applied to quantification
of upper-body motion impairment in stroke patients, and severity of knee osteoarthritis from magneticresonance imaging scans.
